                The <b>Culpeo Fox</b> perfectly embodies the spirit of those who participate in ICPC. 
                It is an <b>>intelligent, curious, and adaptable animal,</b capable of moving with agility 
                in challenging environments and solving problems with cunning, <b>much like what teams 
                experience during the competition.</b>

                This fox is one of Chile's most representative animals, found throughout much of the country. 
                The culpeo fox is found in almost all of Chile, from sea level to an altitude of 4,500 meters, 
                adapting to a wide variety of environments such as the coast, the desert, the Andes mountains, 
                forests, and the steppe, ranging from Arica to Magallanes and Tierra del Fuego, and is the 
                largest fox in the country. Although it also lives in other parts of Latin America, its strong 
                presence in Chile makes it <b>the perfect symbol for thisedition of the competition held in Santiago.</b> 
                Thus, our mascot connects the host country's identity with the talent, diversity, and Latin American 
                spirit that define ICPC.
