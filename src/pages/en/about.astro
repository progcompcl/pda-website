        <p class="text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
          The International Collegiate Programming Contest is the oldest, largest and
          most prestigious programming contest for university students. In teams of
          three, students represent their institutions, practicing their algorithmic
          skills, teamwork, creativity and the ability to perform under pressure.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
          Since the first championship in 1977, the ICPC has evolved into a global
          competition, with universities around the world hosting regional rounds that
          qualify teams for the World Finals. For this purpose, the Latin America
          Championship brings together the best Latin American teams.
