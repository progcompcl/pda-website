          The International Collegiate Programming Contest is the oldest, largest and
          most prestigious programming contest for university students. In teams of

        <p class="text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
          Since the first championship in 1977, the ICPC has evolved into a global
          competition, with universities around the world hosting regional rounds that
          qualify teams for the World Finals. For this purpose, the Latin America
          Championship brings together the best Latin American teams.

                The Culpeo Fox perfectly embodies the spirit of those who participate in ICPC. It is an intelligent, curious, and adaptable animal, capable of moving with agility in challenging environments and solving problems with cunning, much like what teams experience during the competition.

                This fox is one of Chile's most representative animals, found throughout much of the country. The culpeo fox is found in almost all of Chile, from sea level to an altitude of 4,500 meters, adapting to a wide variety of environments such as the coast, the desert, the Andes mountains, forests, and the steppe, ranging from Arica to Magallanes and Tierra del Fuego, and is the largest fox in the country. Although it also lives in other parts of Latin America, its strong presence in Chile makes it the perfect symbol for thisedition of the competition held in Santiago. Thus, our mascot connects the host country's identity with the talent, diversity, and Latin American spirit that define ICPC.
